Traveling to one point, they find a town where all the ponies have the same cutie mark, an equal sign. The friends suspect something is wrong with the townfolk, particularly after meeting their leader, Starlight Glimmer. Starlight shows that all the ponies living there have given up their cutie marks and special talents, as they believe that they can achieve true friendship by being of equal skill. Twilight and her friends secretly meet with other ponies who desire their cutie marks again, and travel to a vault where the marks are kept. Upon arrival, the six are lured into a trap and Starlight is able to take their marks.</blockquote><br>\nSeason 5 episode 2:<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>Without their cutie marks, the six friends are trapped in the village while Starlight Glimmer waits for them to accept their fate.
