The \"trace\" herein isn't some fantasy masterpiece, or something attractive but unrelated to me, or some stuff&nbsp;manufactured to pleasure me by BigData. It's what I have made and left in the world, even though it may be too old to make any sense. Someone once told me \"You are too tough on yourself\". It's it. Even if I just chatted with people I can capture some of my awkward mistakes or&nbsp;improper words, and draw the conclusion that I'm useless or disliked. Of course, it's not that case. But I still failed to completely get rid of this&nbsp;surmise, and I don't know the reason why.","date":"2020-08-19","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
