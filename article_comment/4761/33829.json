People are getting more extreme on both sides, and each side wants to annihilate the other, with no compromise.&nbsp;It is a shame to see that Internet nowadays divides instead of uniting people, due to the echo-chamber effect. Unfortunately, President Trump did not fix the problem, but made it a lot worse. The conservatives have become more radical in terms of protesting, which eventually led to storming the capitol. On the other hand, the liberals have become more conservative by applying political correctness and suppressing the real freedom of speech everywhere. I sincerely hope that people can be kind and honest one day again.","date":"2021-01-21","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
