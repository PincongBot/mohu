I was so excited because I have been living in America for ten years but haven’t eat anything as good as traditional Chinese food. I remember once my dad took me to a restaurant and we ordered roast kidney, I asked him why it tastes so nice but he didn’t really want to answer my question and just said something quite weird in a low voice. That was the last time I ate something delicious, after I came to the US I have never tried anything as good as roast kidney. Now we have a new president, maybe this is the chance of have some roast kidney!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n9 am in the morning, I just woke up but President Biden’s Ground force one already arrived. I stepped in the car and said hello to president Biden, although he is nearly 80 years old, full white hair, but still looked quite healthy. When I sat down I asked him what are we going to have today? He said we are going to try a new pizza today! I was quite sad that we are not having roast kidney but he told me it’s a brand new pizza and no one has ever tried it. He sweared in the name of US president that it would be the best pizza ever!<br>\n<br>\nAfter a while the car stopped and I thought it’s the pizza restaurant but it’s the Los Angeles airport. President Biden smiled and told me the restaurant is in the District of Columbia so we have to take the plane. We went onto his private jet and I think it was previously owned by a billionaire. After landing we left the plane and went into ground force one again. Finally we arrived at the pizza restaurant which is called “Comet Ping Pong”.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe walked in and the waiter took us to a box. There were so many people, Secretary Clinton, Ambassador Cui and Mr Podesta. When they saw us, all of them gave a warm welcome and congratulated President Biden. President Biden introduced me to them and said this is the daughter of General Secretary Xi, without his help we would not achieve this victory so easily! Let’s thank Mr Xi and Ambassador Cui!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n未完待续","date":"2020-09-12","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
