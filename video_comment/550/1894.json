And the most important thing I was trained to do is only ever shoot if it's a clean kill. You never take any action that will cause undue suffering to the animal. This practice of torture is absolutely abhorrent. I give a lot of room for people's culture but some things are flat out disgusting. I have no respect for this kind of ignorant garbage. Good on you for bringing the truth forward brother.</blockquote><br>\n这是下面的一个英文评论，翻译过来就是：<br>\n<blockquote>我是在一个猎人家庭长大的。我在训练中被告知，最重要的是捕猎要干净利落。你绝不能对动物施加任何不当的折磨。折磨虐待当然是非常恶心的行为。我对人们的文化非常宽容，但是有些事实在是直白的恶心。我对这种无知的垃圾不会给予任何尊重。兄弟，感谢你带来事实真相。</blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n在中国对动物缺乏善待，缺乏善良，会不会真的是缺乏信仰和宗教文化的关系？","date":"2020-11-07","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
