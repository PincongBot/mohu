How about the brandnew status about Coronavirus-defending in your country? Does everything go well? Dies your president recieved the coins-spraying by our emperor?<br>\n<br>\nDo you know that we just had a fun festival that calls \"Duan-Niu\" （端牛）<br>\nIt's said that there was a patriotic poet who drowned himself into a river. This river is called \"Jiang\" in our mother tongue.<br>\n<br>\nOn the other hand, I present you a subculture that is called \"Toad-worshipping\". We worship a former leader of PRC (Jiang Zemin) to oppose the current leader.<br>\n<br>\nThe Zhihu.com was a huge toad-worshipping hub. One of members (贺仙) dared to use this culture to oppose our government. One day, he wrote \"I love this patriot-poet, because he downed himself into the Jiang. (Literally: 我喜欢屈原，因为他晚年投江。）\" This user was lucky, he never got a warning even he did hidden Toad-worshipping - However, he finally got a present from Zhihu-moderator: Force to silence into 7 days.<br>\n<br>\nApprently you won't want to come to China, not having this fun with us. Otherwise you might get whole shit spraying on your face. Ah Shit on your face.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://mohu.rocks/video/132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Well, please excuse me that I have to improvise just like I (pretent that) don't have any available scripts by hand：<br>\nMon tres cher ami, 我很抱歉要说那. Merci beaucoup! </a><br>\n<br>\nSincerely yours,<br>\n<br>\nHellas<br>\n<br>\n25.June.2020","date":"2020-06-26","agreeCount":8,"discussionCount":1}
