Islam only forbids homosexuality acts such as kissing men (if you're men) and doing other sexual acts with the same gender as you but nowhere in the entire Qur'an, hadith (sayins), principles of Sh'i, etc. i dont care what, does it say that being gay is forbidden. <br>\n<br>\n“A person is not to be blamed for his nature. Rather, he is to be blamed if he acts according to his nature.” -Al-Junayd in ‘Hilyat al-Awliya” <br>\n<br>\nIn fact, being homo/bi/lesbian/etc. is a test from God in Islam as God describes this wordly life as a test and ticket to Paradise or Hell and nothing more. The real life start after death (in Paradise or Hell). Yes, this is a bigger test since you can't preform any homosexuality act but the bigger your test is, the bigger your suffering is, the bigger your reward is IF and only IF you've shown patience.”","date":"2018-04-14","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
