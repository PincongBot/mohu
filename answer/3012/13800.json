Dismantling these bloated and inefficient firms would thus amount to political suicide. Yet protecting them may merely delay the inevitable, because the longer they are allowed to suck scarce resources out of the economy, the more unaffordable an arms race with the US will become – and the greater the challenge to the CPC’s authority will become.\"<br>\n<br>\n– 裴敏欣，Project Syndicate，<i>China is Losing the New Cold War</i><br>\n<br>\nhttps://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-cold-war-us-competition-by-minxin-pei-2018-09[i]<br>\n[/i]","date":"2018-09-29","agreeCount":1,"discussionCount":0}
