But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous Revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: <b>“Men have forgotten God; that’s why all this has happened.”</b></blockquote><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/zEprULi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zEprULi.png\" alt=\"https://i.imgur.com/zEprULi.png\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></a>","date":"2020-11-14","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
