Still, it continues to be treated unjustly around the globe at the PRC’s will. We call on the US to restore formal ties with the ROC and take actions to facilitate the ROC’s return to the UN, so as to protect the legitimate rights of the 23 million people living in Taiwan and the common interests shared by the free world.<br>\n<br>\nThe US transferred diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the PRC, a communist regime, in 1979, following the ROC’s forced withdrawal from the UN in 1971. Yet this old paradigm has now proven obsolete as the PRC has been undermining the common values shared by the free world, endangering regional peace.<br>\n<br>\nIt's time to get <b>Free China</b> back.<br>\n<br>\n<u>你没看错，是中国（Free China）。<br>\n</u>","date":"2020-09-02","agreeCount":3,"discussionCount":0}
