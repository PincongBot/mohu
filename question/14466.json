Thousands of foreigners, and no walled-up Chinese’s around – nobody Chinese, I mean – except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some cliff near the crazy universe. What I have to do, I have to eliminate everybody in the name of the eradication of poverty if some foreigner splashes shit over my face – I mean if they’re poking biogas digesters and they don’t know where the shit would splash on. I have to put down the wheat weighing 100 kilograms on my shoulder and eliminate them in the name of the eradication of poverty. That’s all I do like a primary school pupil all day. I’d just be the wheatbearer in the rye and all. I know it’s like Winnie the Pooh travelling among the stars in the crazy universe, but that’s the only thing I’d really like to be.’","date":"2021-02-16","agreeCount":4,"discussionCount":0}
