COVID-19 is killing thousands each day in France and in Europe, where governments are calling for an end to shelter-at-home policies, pushing a frightened population back to work. At the same time, an anticommunist campaign is spreading in the French media to blame China, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, for the disaster unfolding in Europe.<br>\n<br>\nOn Sunday, an anonymous Chinese diplomat posted a long note in French on the embassy web site, criticizing the European ruling elites. “China’s victory over the epidemic makes them bitter. With their concocted arguments, claiming that China ‘delayed its reaction’ and ‘hid the truth,’ they present China as principally responsible for the pandemic. … At the same time, in the West, we saw politicians tearing each other apart for votes, calling for herd immunity, which meant abandoning their citizens to face the viral onslaught alone, and stealing shipments of medicine from each other.”<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</blockquote><br>\n在周日，衣名中国外交官员匿名钦点欧洲防护新冠疫情政策，还不忘及时自夸：“中国在此次疫情的胜利让他们和他们编造的论点（中国当局未能及时行动，隐藏事实etc）苦涩不已”，结果让法国政府十分安格瑞，召见了中国外交官。然而，法国政府因从中国购买的口罩尚有大量没有运过来而没有措辞苛刻。<br>\n<br>\n此时正在中南海骑在习明泽身上掀翻小池塘的庆丰帝听到这则消息江会乳何反应？他是否会马匹不仁岿然不动撸起袖子加油干，抑或是颐使气指不运了睡大觉将六亿口罩全部拉清单？","date":"2020-04-16","agreeCount":2,"discussionCount":0}
