It has curtailed the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. It is clear that the National Security Law is being used to eliminate dissent and opposing political views.<br>\n<br>\nWe call on the Hong Kong and Chinese central authorities&nbsp;to respect the legally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong without fear of arrest and detention.&nbsp;It is crucial that the postponed Legislative Council elections in September proceed in a fair way that includes candidates representing a range of political opinions.","date":"2021-01-22","agreeCount":0,"discussionCount":0}
